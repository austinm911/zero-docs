title: Server-Side Rendering (SSR)
---

Zero does not currently support SSR ([patches welcome though!](https://bugs.rocicorp.dev/issue/3491)).

You should use your framework's recommended pattern to prevent SSR execution.

## Next.js

Add the `use client`
[directive](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/directives/use-client).

## SolidStart

Wrap components that use Zero with the
[`clientOnly`](https://docs.solidjs.com/solid-start/reference/client/client-only)
higher-order component.

The standard `clientOnly` pattern uses dynamic imports, but note that this
approach (similar to [React's `lazy`](https://react.dev/reference/react/lazy))
works with any function returning a `Promise<{default: () => JSX.Element}>`. If
code splitting is unnecessary, you can skip the dynamic import.

## TanStack Start

Use [React's `lazy`](https://react.dev/reference/react/lazy) for dynamic
imports.
