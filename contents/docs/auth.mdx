title: Authentication
---

Zero uses a [JWT](https://jwt.io/)-based flow to authenticate connections to zero-cache.

## Frontend

During login:

1. Your API server creates a `JWT` and sends it to your client.
2. Your client constructs a `Zero` instance with this token by passing it to the `auth` option.

<Note type="note" slug="user-id">
  When you set the `auth` option you must set the `userID` option to the same
  value that is present in the `sub` field of the token.
</Note>

```ts
const zero = new Zero({
  ...,
  auth: token, // your JWT
  userID, // this must match the `sub` field from `token`
});
```

## Server

For `zero-cache` to be able to verify the JWT, one of the following environment variables needs to be set:

1. `ZERO_AUTH_SECRET` - If your API server uses a symmetric key (secret) to create JWTs then this is that same key.
2. `ZERO_AUTH_JWK` - If your API server uses a private key to create JWTs then this is the corresponding public key, in [JWK](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7517) format.
3. `ZERO_AUTH_JWKS_URL` - Many auth providers host the public keys used to verify the JWTs they create at a public URL. If you use a provider that does this, or you publish your own keys publicly, set this to that URL.

## Refresh

The `auth` parameter to Zero can also be a function:

```ts
const zero = new Zero({
  ...,
  auth: async () => {
    const token = await fetchNewToken();
    return token;
  },
  userID,
});
```

In this case, Zero will call this function to get a new JWT if verification fails.

## Data Storage

In essence, Zero creates a partial replication of the database, and stores it in the browser's IndexedDB. Because data is often unique to each user, synced data is segregated. This is done with two values that can be set on the client:

- `userID`
- `storageKey`

Only `userID` is required and ensures data segregation on the user level. `storageKey`, on the other hand, can be used to segregate data withn a single user—organizations, projects, workspaces, etc.

### Logging In

When a user is authenticated, you create a new Zero instance with the user's `userID`. Then, an IndexedDB is created and data is synced. It works the same when using `storageKey` but instead of creating a new Zero instance on authentication, you do this when switching organization, project, workspace, etc.

### Logging Out

When a user logs out, there are two common scenarios:

1. **No access**: The user has no access to the application, and thus, there is no Zero instance.
2. **Anonymous access**: You allow anonymous access, and you create a Zero instance with an anonymous `userID` (e.g. `anon`).

It is crucial to understand that, in both cases, **Zero does not automatically clear locally cached data on "logout" by default.** To Zero, changing `userID` or `storageKey` is only about creating or switching between IndexedDB instances. All data can still be read when inspecting the IndexedDB, wether the user is logged in or not.

Zero provides the `dropAllDatabases` function to—as the name suggests—clear all IndexedDB databases from the browser. This function should be called on "log out" when it is essential to leave no cached data on-device.

Doing this does require Zero to build up a new cache every time a new instance is created. But because Zero only does a partial sync, this shouldn't be prohibitively expensive.

## Permissions

Any data placed into your JWT (claims) can be used by permission rules on the backend.

```ts
const isAdminRule = (decodedJWT, {cmp}) => cmp(decodedJWT.role, '=', 'admin');
```

See the [permissions](permissions) section for more details.
