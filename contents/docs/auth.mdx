title: Authentication
---

Zero uses a [JWT](https://jwt.io/)-based flow to authenticate connections to zero-cache.

## Frontend

During login:

1. Your API server creates a `JWT` and sends it to your client.
2. Your client constructs a `Zero` instance with this token by passing it to the `auth` option.

<Note type="note" slug="user-id">
  When you set the `auth` option you must set the `userID` option to the same
  value that is present in the `sub` field of the token.
</Note>

```ts
const zero = new Zero({
  ...,
  auth: token, // your JWT
  userID, // this must match the `sub` field from `token`
});
```

## Server

For `zero-cache` to be able to verify the JWT, one of the following environment variables needs to be set:

1. `ZERO_AUTH_SECRET` - If your API server uses a symmetric key (secret) to create JWTs then this is that same key.
2. `ZERO_AUTH_JWK` - If your API server uses a private key to create JWTs then this is the corresponding public key, in [JWK](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7517) format.
3. `ZERO_AUTH_JWKS_URL` - Many auth providers host the public keys used to verify the JWTs they create at a public URL. If you use a provider that does this, or you publish your own keys publicly, set this to that URL.

## Refresh

The `auth` parameter to Zero can also be a function:

```ts
const zero = new Zero({
  ...,
  auth: async () => {
    const token = await fetchNewToken();
    return token;
  },
  userID,
});
```

In this case, Zero will call this function to get a new JWT if verification fails.

## Logging out

Data is segregated by `userID`. So, when creating a new Zero instance with a different (or anonymous) `userID`, the data is stored in a separate IndexedDB. It is therefore important to know that Zero does not handle clearing chached data on "log out" on its own.

Zero provides the `dropAllDatabases()` function to —as the name suggests— clear all IndexedDB databases from the browser. If it is important to leave no data on device, this function can be called on "log out".

Doing this does require Zero to build up a new cache every time a new instance is created. But because of Zero's architecture this shouldn't be prohibitively expensive.

## Permissions

Any data placed into your JWT (claims) can be used by permission rules on the backend.

```ts
const isAdminRule = (decodedJWT, {cmp}) => cmp(decodedJWT.role, '=', 'admin');
```

See the [permissions](permissions) section for more details.
