title: When To Use (And Not Use) Zero
---

We are trying to make Zero a great choice for a wide variety of applications. But every tool has tradeoffs, and Zero especially so [while in alpha](./status).

This page will help you understance if Zero is a good fit for you today.

## Zero Might be a Good Fit

- You are building a traditional client/server web app
- You use PostgreSQL, and want a traditional database schema
- Your application has complex server-side validation or business logic that can make use of [custom mutators](./custom-mutators)
- You need [fine-grained permissions](permissions) (read/write access depends on the groups a user is in, what has been shared with them, their role, etc.)
- You cannot reasonably sync all data a user has access to onto the client, or don't want to for startup perf reasons
- Your app is broadly "like Linear" – a productivity app with lots of interactivity
- Interaction performance is very important to you

## Zero Might Not be a Good Fit

- You need the privacy or data ownership benefits of [local-first](https://www.inkandswitch.com/essay/local-first/)
- You need to support [offline writes](./offline) or long periods offline
- You are building a native mobile app
- Your app is an ecommerce app, a social media app, a game, a marketing site, or otherwise not very much "like Linear"
- The total backend dataset is > ~1TB

## Zero Might Not be a Good Fit **Yet**

While Zero is in alpha, there are additional reasons to not choose:

- You are not comfortable running server-side infra like Docker containers (you currently have to [self-host](./deployment) Zero – we're working on a SaaS solution)
- You can't tolerate occasional downtime (the easiest way to run Zero today is single-node, which requires downtime for updates. Also there are occasional regressions.)
- You need immediate support for React Native ([planned](./roadmap), but not ready yet)
- You need support for SSR ([planned](./roadmap), but not ready yet)

## Alternatives

If Zero isn't right for you, here are some good alternatives to consider:

- [Automerge](https://automerge.org/): Local-first, CRDT-based solution. Pioneering branch-based offline support.
- [Convex](https://www.convex.dev/): Not a sync engine (reads and writes are server-first), but a very nice reactive database that is in GA.
- [Ditto](https://www.ditto.com/): CRDT-based, with high quality offline support.
- [Electric](https://electric-sql.com/): Postgres-based sync engine with a SaaS cloud.
- [LiveStore](https://livestore.dev/): Interesting event sourced design from one of the founders of Prisma.
- [Jazz](https://jazz.tools/): Batteries-included local-first.
- [Powersync](https://powersync.com/): Sync engine that works with Postgres, MySQL, and MongoDB.
