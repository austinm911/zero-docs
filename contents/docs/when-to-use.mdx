title: When To Use Zero (and When Not To)
---

We are trying to make Zero a great choice for a wide variety of applications. But every tool has tradeoffs, and Zero especially so [while in alpha](./status).

## Zero Might be a Good Fit

- You are building a traditional client/server web app
- You are building a desktop web app, or a web-based mobile app
- You use PostgreSQL
- You want to use a traditional database schema
- Offline writes are not needed
- Your application has a complex server-side (AI, complex business logic, etc.)
- You need fine-grained permissions (read/write access depends on the groups a user is in, what has been shared with them, their role, etc.)
- You cannot reasonably sync all data a user has access to onto the client, or don't want to for startup perf reasons
- The total backend dataset is < ~100GB
- You are comfortable running server-side infra like Docker containers
- You can tolerate occasional downtime (e.g., for server updates, regressions)
- Your app is broadly "like Linear" – a productivity app with lots of interactivity
- Interaction performance is very important to you

## Zero Might Not be a Good Fit

- You need the privacy or data ownership benefits of [local-first](TODO)
- You need to support offline writes or long periods offline
- You don't want to run server infrastructure
- You have a major app already in prodution and need to minimize downtime
- You are building a non-web mobile app
- Your app is broadly not "like Linear" – e.g., an ecommerce app, a social media app, a game, a marketing site, etc.
- You need startup speed (LCP) to be as fast as possible
- You need support for crawlers

## Alternatives

If Zero isn't right for you, here are some good alternatives to consider:

- [Electric](https://electric-sql.com/)
- [LiveStore](TODO)
- [Powersync](TODO)
- [Convex](TODO)
- [Ditto](TODO)
- [Automerge](TODO)
