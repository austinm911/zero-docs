title: Offline Support
---
Zero supports offline *reads*. Any data cached locally continues to be accessible while offline.

Currently, Zero also continues to work offline for *writes*, but we do not plan to support this feature and it will be removed before beta. Our plan is that when disconnected, Zero will go into an *offline mode* where all mutations throw and Zero becomes read-only.

Until then, we recommend that you detect when the user is offline using the `onOnlineChange` constructor parameter and disable write functionality in your app manually.

## More Information

Offline writes are a very complicated subject.

While technically Zero can queue writes and replay them when reconnected (this happens by default in a sync engine), building apps that correctly support offline writes is very difficult.

When offline for long periods, the actual *intent* of users can diverge resulting in complex conflicts that cannot automatically be resolved. Or, the server software and database schema may diverge from client such that offline mutations can no longer be processed. In either of these cases, simply replaying offline writes can result in arbitrarily large amount of user data loss.

  For these reasons, Zero is currently focused on the benefits that sync provides for the 99% of time most users and most apps are *online*. Specifically: instant user interactions and automatic reactivity. Providing a great *offline* experience is not currently a priority. We may revisit this in the future.
