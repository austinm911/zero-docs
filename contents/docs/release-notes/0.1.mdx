title: Zero 0.1
description: First Release
---

## Breaking changes

- The name of some config keys in `zero.config.json` changed:
  - `upstreamUri` â†’ `upstreamDBConnStr`
  - `cvrDbUri` â†’ `cvrDBConnStr`
  - `changeDbUri` â†’ `changeDBConnStr`
  - `replicaDbFile` â†’ `replicaDBFile`
- Changed default port of `zero-cache` to `4848` . So your app startup should look like `VITE_PUBLIC_SERVER="http://localhost:4848"`.

## Features

- Print a warning to js console when Zero constructor `server` param is `null` or `undefined`
- zero-cache should now correctly bind to both ipv4 and ipv6 loopback addresses. This should fix the issue where using `localhost` to connect to zero-cache on some systems did not work.
- Check for presence of `WebSocket` early in startup of `Zero`. Print a clear error to catch people accidentally running Zero under SSR.
- Fix annoying error in js console in React strict mode from constructing and closing Replicache in quick succession.

## Source tree fixes

These only apply if you were working in the Rocicorp monorepo.

- Fixed issue where zbugs didnâ€™t rebuild when zero dependency changed - generally zbugs build normally again
- The zero binary has the right permissions bit so you donâ€™t have to chmod u+x after build
- Remove overloaded name `snapshot` in use-query.tsx (thanks Scott ðŸ™ƒ)
