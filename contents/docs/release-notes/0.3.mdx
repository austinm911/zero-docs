title: Zero 0.3
description: Schema Migrations and Write Perms
---

## Install

```bash
npm install @rocicorp/zero@0.3
```

## Breaking changes

- zero.config file is now TypeScript, not JSON. See: https://github.com/rocicorp/hello-zero/blob/07c08b1f86b526a96e281ee65af672f52a59bcee/zero.config.ts.

## Features

- **Schema Migrations:** Zero now has first-class support for schema migration ([documentation](/docs/zero-schema/#migrations)).
- **Write Permissions:** First-class write permissions based on ZQL ([documentation](/docs/auth)).
- **Date/Time related types:** Zero now natively supports the TIMESTAMP and DATE Postgres types ([sample app](https://github.com/rocicorp/hello-zero/blob/main/src/schema.ts), [documentation](/docs/postgres-support)).
- **SolidJS:** We now have first-class support for SolidJS ([documentation](/docs/solidjs)).
- **Intellisense for Schema Definition:** Introduce `createSchema` and `createTableSchema` helper functions to enable intellisense when defining shemas. See [Sample App](https://github.com/rocicorp/hello-zero/blob/main/src/schema.ts#L10).
- **`escapeLike()` :** Add helper to properly escape strings for use in `LIKE` filters. See [Sample App](https://github.com/rocicorp/hello-zero/blob/main/src/App.tsx#L37).
- **New QuickStart App:** Entirely rewrote the [setup/sample flow](/docs/quickstart) to (a) make it much faster to get started playing with Zero, and (b) demonstrate more features.

## Fixes

- The `@rocicorp/zero` package now downloads a prebuilt sqlite instead of compiling it locally. This significantly speeds up install.
- Support `rds.force_ssl=1` RDS configuration.
- Fixed bug where sibling subqueries could be lost on edit changes.
- Fixes to error handling to ensure zero-cache prints errors when crashing in multiprocess mode.
- If zero-cache hears from a client with an unknown CVR/cookie, zero-cache forces that client to reset itself and reload automatically. Useful during development when server-state is frequently getting cleared.

## Docs

- Started work to make [real docs](/docs/introduction). Not quite done yet.

## zbugs

https://bugs.rocicorp.dev/ (pw: zql)

- Improve startup perf: ~3s → ~1.5s Hawaii ↔ US East. More work to do here but good progress.
- Responsive design for mobile.
- “Short IDs”: Bugs now have a short numeric ID, not a random hash. See [Demo Video](https://discord.com/channels/830183651022471199/1288232858795769917/1298114323272568852).
- First-class label picker.
- Unread indicators.
- Finish j/k support for paging through issues. It’s now “search-aware”, it pages through issues in order of search you clicked through to detail page in.
- Text search (slash to activate — needs better discoverability)
- Emojis on issues and comments
- Sort controls on list view
- remove fps meter temporarily
- numerous other UI polish
