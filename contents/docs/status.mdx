<Note type="warning" emoji="ðŸš§" heading="Zero is in Alpha">
Zero is a new sync engine based on a novel streaming query engine. This is an ambitious project at an early stage.

You will encounter bugs. You may encounter pathologically slow queries. You are likely to encounter situations where ZQL is not powerful enough to express the
query you want.

That said, we are building Zero live. It has been running [our own bug tracker](https://zbugs.rocicorp.dev) for months, and is used in production by a small set of customer applications that are an extremely good fit.

This page describes the current state of Zero at a high level. To understand whether Zero makes sense for you, please also see [When to Use Zero](./when-to-use).

## Platforms and Frameworks

* [React](./react), [React Native](./react-native), and [SolidJS](./solidjs) are fully-supported
* [Svelte and Vue](community) have community support
* We have strong support for [TanStack](https://x.com/aboodman/status/1941914143961071635)

## Databases

* Most Postgres providers [are supported](connecting-to-postgres)
* [Drizzle and Prisma](community) have high-quality community-supported integrations

## API

* The API is in rapid development. We are deprecating the original "CRUD" mutators and ad-hoc queries and replacing them with the more flexible [custom mutators](/docs/custom-mutators) and [synced queries](/docs/synced-queries). Because documentation for both sets of features still exist, the docs are more complex than ideal.
* Also the new APIs are still being refined and have some rough edges.

## Query Language

* Filters, sorts, limits, relationships, and `exists` [are supported](./reading-data).
* Queries can have [`ttl`](reading-data#background-queries) to keep data synced across sessions.
* [Aggregates](roadmap) (count, min, max, group-by) are not yet supported.
* [Full-text search](roadmap) is not yet supported (you can sometimes simulate with `ILIKE`, though it scales linearly).
* Infinite/virtual scroll is possible, but we do not yet have a library/API for it. See [zbugs](/docs/samples#zbugs) source for how to do this.

## Performance

* Zero plans single-table queries (choosing the right index, etc) by delegating to SQLite and this works well. Zero does not currently auto-plan joins. You can manually plan them using [the `flip` parameter](/docs/reading-data#join-flipping).
* Zero has a basic [console-based inspector](/docs/debug/inspector) that can help to understand query and sync performance. It does not yet have a GUI inspector.
* We share queries within a "client group" (e.g. all tabs in a browser), but not across groups. This means that if you have many users doing the same query, they will duplicate all that work server-side.

## Miscellaneous

* Running Zero requires [deploying it yourself](deployment) to AWS or similar. Running in a [multinode](deployment#guide-multi-node-on-sstaws), zero-downtime way is possible (we do it for zbugs), but significant effort. Running [single node](deployment#guide-single-node-on-flyio) is easier, but updating the server takes it down for a minute or so (we are working on a SaaS solution).
